## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL
- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Other Tools:** Git, IntelliJ, VS Code

## Core Services
- User Management and Authentication
- Admin Management and Reporting
- Policy and Claim Handling
- Commission Calculation
- Email Notifications
- Payment Gateway Integration
- Cloud Storage for Images and Documents

## How to Run
### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
   (1) Open the tool
   This project needs to be opened with the IntelliJ IDEA development software.
   (2) Check the run configuratio
   Check in the 'Menu' if the SDK version in 'Project Structure' is 17 or higher, and whether the 'Language Level' is set to the SDK default value.
   Check if the run/debug configuration is set for Spring Boot.
   
2. Build and run using Gradle/Maven:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew bootRun  # For Gradle
   mvn spring-boot:run  # For Maven
   ```
   You may encounter the issue of 'dependencies cannot be resolved' during runtime.
   Reason:
   This may be a network issue causing Maven to be unable to download dependencies from the remote repository, or the remote repository address may be unavailable.
   The local cache of Maven might contain incorrect metadata, leading to an inability to resolve dependencies correctly. 
   There may be configuration errors in the pom.xml file, such as incorrect repository addresses or dependency versions.
   ```
  How to solve:
  
   (1) Check the dependency version
   Open the Maven Central Repository.
   Search for "org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core"
   Confirm whether version 10.1.39 exists. 
   If it does not exist, switch to an available version (such as 10.1.38).
   ```
   (2) Update pom.xmlIf the version does not exist, modify the dependency version in the pom.xml file. For example:
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
      <artifactId>tomcat-embed-core</artifactId>
      <version>10.1.38</version> <!-- Change to the existing version -->
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

    (3) Clean the Maven cache
    Maven's local cache may contain erroneous metadata. 
    You can clean the local cache using the following command:
    mvn dependency:purge-local-repository Or manually delete the local Maven cache directory (the default path is ~/.m2/repository)

    (4) Force update dependencies
     Run the following command to force Maven to update dependencies: mvn clean install -U
     
     Note: The -U option forces Maven to check and update the snapshot versions (SNAPSHOT) of dependencies. If the project uses snapshot version dependencies, these dependencies may introduce incompatible changes after the update. 
     - Solutions:
     • Carefully check the version update logs of the dependencies before updating to understand potential incompatible changes.
     • Conduct thorough testing in the development environment to ensure that the updated dependencies do not affect the functionality of the project.

    (5) Check your network connection.
    Ensure that your network can access the Maven Central Repository (`https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/`).
    If there are network issues, you may try configuring a proxy or switching to another network.

    (6) Check the warehouse configuration.
    Ensure that the <repositories> configuration in pom.xml is correct. For example:
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>central</id>
        <url>https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    (7) Check the IDE cache.
    If you are using an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse), you may need to clean the IDE's cache.
    File   ->   Invalidate Caches / Restart   ->   Invalidate and Restart  

    Following the steps outlined above should resolve the issue of dependency resolution failure.

# Register Component
## Directory Structure
register/
├── register.component.css     # Styles for the registration component
├── register.component.html    # HTML template for the registration form
├── register.component.spec.ts # Unit tests for the registration component
└── register.component.ts      # TypeScript file for registration logic

## Purpose
Allows new users to create an account by entering and verifying their details.

## Features
### Input Fields:
- 1.name: Required field validation
- 2.Password and Confirm Password: Length validation and matching check
- 3.Email: Format validation and duplicate checking
### Buttons:
- 1.Login: Redirects existing users to login page
- 2.Register: Submits form to create account
### Validation:
- 1.Ensures all fields are filled
- 2.Validates password matching and email format
- 3.Checks for existing email addresses
Shows server-side error messages for invalid credentials
### Routing:
- 1.Primary route: /register
- 2.Redirects to /login after successful registration

## TypeScript Logic
1.Form Validation: 
- Reactive Form with strong typing
- Synchronous and asynchronous validators
- Cross-field validation (password matching)
- Custom email uniqueness check
- Real-time error feedback
2.Account Creation:
- HTTP POST request with user data
- Loading state management
- Graceful error handling
- Success notification
3.Navigation: Uses Router service for redirection
- Post-registration routing
- Error-aware redirects
```
// Key components include:
// Core Components & Techniques:
- FormGroup with generic typing
- Custom validators & async validators
- RxJS for asynchronous operations
- DTO mapping
- HTTP error handling
- Loading state management
- Reactive programming patterns
- Dependency injection
```

## Key Enhancements:
- Strong Typing: Generic FormGroup and DTO interfaces
- Modular Validation: Separated synchronous/async validators
- Error Handling: HTTP status code mapping
- Security: Password strength validation
- UX Improvements: Loading indicators, form state management
- Code Quality: Private methods, clear separation of concerns
- Testability: Isolated validation logic
- Performance: Optimized validation triggers
## Dependencies
Angular FormsModule
Angular RouterModule
Custom UserService for API calls
Validation service/utilities

## Testing
